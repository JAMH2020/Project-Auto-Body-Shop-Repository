                        <p>The Consumer Protection Act, 2002 (Ontario) provides you with rights in relation to having a motor vehicle repaired. Among other things, you have a right to a written estimate. A repairer may not charge an amount that is more than ten (10) per cent above that estimate. If you waived your right to an estimate, the repairer must have your authorization of the maximum amount that you will pay for the repairs. The repairer may not charge more than the maximum amount you authorized. In either case, the repairer may not charge for any work you did not authorize.</p> <br>
                        <p>If you have concerns about the work or repairs performed by the repairer or about your rights or duties under the Consumer Protection Act, 2002, (Ontario) you should contact the Ministry of Consumer and Business Services.</p> <br>
