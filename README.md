# Project-Auto-Body-Shop-Repository

Hello there!

If you are reading this then you have been given access to all aspects of Team JAHMs' code. Each section is divided based on where 
everything belongs. All backend forms for inserting data into the database is mostly contained within the database section. Some of the
html is available, whereas all forms and their dtabase inserts are available here, as well as most of the images. Feel free to look around
and if any edits are required please do not hesitate to let us know! Have a good day!

                                                                                                        - Team JAHM
